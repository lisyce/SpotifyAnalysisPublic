                    Popular music has always been a reflection of the culture that promotes it, and the United States is no exception. 
                    From the Beatles to Taylor Swift, society has been on a musical journey. But, how can this be measured? 
                    The Billboard Hot 100 chart publishes the top tracks in the United States (based on record sales, streams, 
                    and radio play) weekly, and has done so since 1958. While not all-encompassing of popular culture, the top tracks in the nation 
                    certainly have a basis for describing its values.

                  <p class="card-text text-start">
                    Spotify's Web API provides a great tool to analyze these tracks, generating data
                    regarding certain audio features in the tracks such as "valence" (mood), "danceability", "acousticness", and many more. With this 
                    resource (combined with lyrical analysis), there is certainly a 
                    wealth of data about popular music. From the year 2000 and onward, there has been a prominent shift in what popular music sounds 
                    like, who it's made by, and what values it promotes.

              The time signature of a song describes the feel or pulse of the beat, and it turns out one is easily the most popular.
              For decades, 80% or more of the songs on the Hot 100 have featured a 4/4 time signature, also known as "common time".
              Common time gets 4 beats to a measure.
              As its alias suggests, common time is the most used time signature, even outside of music that hits the Hot 100.

              The tempo of a song describes how fast the song is. While there are some nuances to tempo
              (such as songs that get 3 beats to a slower pulse so they feel 3 times as fast as their tempo states),
              Hot 100 hits' tempos can generally be taken at face value. For a long time, popular tracks have tended
              to average from about 110 to 140 beats per minute, which is fairly upbeat.

              The typicality of a song, as determined by researchers Noh Askin and Michael Mauskapf (2017),
              is how similar a song sounds to its peers released around the same time. They note that
              other popular tracks released by other artists "have a significant impact on [a] song's success" (p. 933).
              In other words, music that makes the Hot 100 tends to resemble the features of popular music releasing at the
              same time, but it has something special that sets it apart and makes it memorable.

            Popular music has always been predominately about love. It's a quintessential experience for media to portray, and music is no exception.
            A statistical analysis of the tracks from the history of the Billboard Top 100 (the year-end version of the Hot 100) reveals that
            "love" is overwhelmingly the most frequently used word in these songs, with over 15,000 occurrances across 70 years of the chart (Nachman et al. 2018).
            Love has been a very popular topic for music, and it appears that isn't changing any time soon.

            <h4>Love is as popular as ever, but it's got more dimensions represented in today's music.</h4>
            <p>
              Despite love dominating the music industry to this day, the ways in which we sing about love are changing.
              Shane Snow (2015) Describes this phenomenon as a shift "from simply sappy to a mix of upbeat and dark--
              partying, lusting, loving, living, and losing" (para. 12). American popular culture is becoming more accepting
              of expressing more emotions in music, particularly negative ones.
              There is a greater freedom of expression in recent music, generating more opportunities for creativity.

                    Duration of tracks on the Hot 100 has been on a steady decline since the turn of the century, seeing a decrease 
                    of about a minute in track duration. This is a substantial amount of time, as almost every track in the Hot 100's history
                    tends to be under 5 minutes of duration. Nowadays, tracks are hovering around the 3 minute range. While tracks 
                    tend to be shorter, it allows for the ability to listen to more music, and different varieties of music since
                    one track isn't quite so long. Shorter durations may leave some artistic opportunities on the table, but they
                    allow for the audience to have the time to listen to a greater variety of music.

                    Over the years, we've become a lot less reliant on the major key. The key of a track
                    is greatly associated with its mood; major keys tend to be associated with positive emotions
                    and minor keys tend to be associated with more negative emotinos. The percent of tracks on the Hot 100
                    featuring a major key has dropped from a high of 90% in the early 1970s to as low as 50% in 2021, meaning
                    that music making the Hot 100 seems to be expressing a greater variety of moods than in the past, with a 
                    higher portion of moods that are more likely to be negative.

                    Starting in the 1990s, there was a cultural shift regarding what types of content were widely acceptable to talk or sing about
                    in popular music. While less than 10% of tracks on the Hot 100 were marked as "explicit" at the beginning of its history,
                    that number has peaked at around 60% in recent years. Although talking about sexually explicit content or using explicit language
                    may be upsetting for some audiences, it does allow for artists to express more visercal emotions and convey their strong
                    feelings with strong language more so now than they were able to in past decades.

                    The "valence" of a track is determined by Spotify's Web API (2022) to be a representation of the "musical postiveness" of a track
                    (Responses section). This value ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values associated with more positive emotions. It is important 
                    to note that this algorithmic approach does not consider lyrics of tracks; only the musical features are considered. Average
                    valence of the Hot 100 tracks has made a moderate decline over the years, suggesting that more tracks are exhibiting smaller
                    valence values. Again, this plays into the idea that artists are more likely to be expressing negative emotions, but that isn't
                    a bad thing! Having a wide range of emotions in popular music allows for amazing creative and artistic decisions in the music industry.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-5">Thinking About Music</h2>
        <p>
          Over the years, American popular music is featuring a large increase in the variety
          of moods expressed, how that music sounds to the listener, and who was involved in making it.
          These past few decades have shown increased diversity and collaboration in the music industry,
          and this allows for even greater types of values and ideas to be expressed. What counts as
          "socially acceptable" to hear has gained a looser definition, allowing for more potentially
          mature or strong feelings to be communicated. Music is art after all, and art isn't always
          representative of positive things in life because, quite frankly, life can be difficult sometimes.
          It is my hope that American popular culture continues to value music as a form of expression,
          and that society listens more closely to what's popular to see who and what is reflected
          in the media consumed every day.
